NodeJS application which provides file version control along with integrity checking
on the Ethereum blockchain network.

This application was made for my bachelor's deegree thesis @ UniPG and is now
being bug-fixed and enhanced.


# Requirements
Requires [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to be installed
and that they can respectively be called using the commands `git` and `node`.


# How to install


Clone the repo and then install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install
```

Then move to the directory where the files and subdirectories to register are
and execute `index.js` like this:

```sh
$ node ../[PATH_TO_PINESU_INSTALLATION]/pinesu/index.js
```
